# Hi, I'm Yaman Khan 👋  

💻 **Full Stack Developer** | ⚙️ **Backend-Focused** | 🌱 **Always Building & Learning**

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into working, scalable web apps.  
My focus is on clean architecture, efficient data flow, and delivering polished user experiences.  

Currently, I’m exploring how system design, API performance, and cloud deployments come together to shape real-world software.

### 🚀 What I’ve Been Building
I’ve recently worked on:
- **A Fullstack Referral & Rewards System** (Next.js + Express + MongoDB)  
  → Built end-to-end authentication, referral logic, and a small integrated store.  
- **BookIt Travel Platform** (React + Node + Prisma + PostgreSQL)  
  → A curated experience booking app with dynamic API integration and pixel-perfect UI.  
- **Data Visualization Dashboard** (FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL)  
  → Upload, analyze, and visualize data in real-time using JWT-secured APIs.  

Each project taught me something new — from async data handling to structuring scalable full-stack systems.

- Docker for containerization
